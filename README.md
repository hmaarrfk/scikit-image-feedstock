Frequent build recipe for scikit-image
======================================

This contains a more nightly build recipe for scikit-image. It pulls the source
from master, which is pretty stable, but since some patches are also included,
the build process won't always be able to apply them all.

The goal is to get to a nightly build, with many of my patches included.
Ideally, these would be uploaded to my own conda channel.

  * Source is pulled from scikit-image master
  * Patches are applied from git pull requests.
  * Build number is generated by the time you compiled it at.
  * Tests are skipped (but might be re-enabled soon)

TODO
  - [x] Get this to build on the CIs
  - [x] Get this to pass on all CIs
  - [ ] change version number to include the date.
  - [ ] remove the date from the build number.
  - [x] Manually change the travis, circleci and appveyor script to upload to my channel instead of conda-forge
  - [x] encrypt my binstar (anaconda) key with [travis](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/)
  - [x] encrypt the key with [appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration/#secure-variables)
  - [x] put the binstar key in circleci's environment [variables](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#overview)

Installing scikit-image
=======================

Installing `scikit-image` from the `mark.harfouche` channel can be achieved by adding `mark.harfouche` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels mark.harfouche
```

Once the `mark.harfouche` channel has been enabled, `scikit-image` can be installed with:

```
conda install scikit-image
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `scikit-image` available on your platform with:

```
conda search scikit-image --channel mark.harfouche
```




Updating scikit-image-feedstock
===============================

If you would like to improve the scikit-image recipe or build a new
package version, please fork this repository and submit a PR. Upon submission,
your changes will be run on the appropriate platforms to give the reviewer an
opportunity to confirm that the changes result in a successful build. Once
merged, the recipe will be re-built and uploaded automatically to the
`mark.harfouche` channel, whereupon the built conda packages will be available for
everybody to install and use from the `mark.harfouche` channel.
Note that all branches in the conda-forge/scikit-image-feedstock are
immediately built and any created packages are uploaded, so PRs should be based
on branches in forks and branches in the main repository should only be used to
build distinct package versions.

In order to produce a uniquely identifiable distribution:
 * If the version of a package **is not** being increased, please add or increase
   the [``build/number``](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/building/meta-yaml.html#build-number-and-string).
 * If the version of a package **is** being increased, please remember to return
   the [``build/number``](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/building/meta-yaml.html#build-number-and-string)
   back to 0.
